## Page 1: Finally, Research Software That Makes Sense

### Your Research Deserves Better Than This

Picture yourself at your desk, transcripts spread before you like pieces of an unmapped puzzle. Each interview holds insights, patterns waiting to emerge, stories that could reshape understanding in your field. Yet between you and these discoveries stands a wall: expensive software demanding thousands of dollars, weeks of training, and worst of all, trust in algorithmic "black boxes" that process your data through unknowable mechanisms.

What if there were another way? What if powerful qualitative analysis could be transparent, immediate, and completely free?

**CAITA rewrites the rules. No licensing fees. No mysterious AI. No compromises.**

**Step 1: Upload Your Data**

Look at this interface. No maze of menus, no overwhelming options. Just drag your transcripts, interviews, or field notes into the upload area. The system accepts everything: Word documents, PDFs, text files. Your research, exactly as you created it.

Notice the codebook options? Beginners can use the default structure, while experienced researchers import their established frameworks. This flexibility respects where you are in your research journey.

**Step 2: Set Your Research Direction**

The configuration screen asks only what matters: What questions drive your research? What key concepts should the system watch for?

See those research question fields? When you type "What barriers do teachers face in implementing technology?" you're not just informing software. You're clarifying your own analytical lens. CAITA uses these to guide suggestions, but more importantly, they keep YOUR interpretation centered.

That keyword slider set to 20? It's based on evidence: 15-25 keywords capture patterns without overwhelming. The system guides you toward best practices without lecturing.

And notice: you can add manual keywords. Because you know your field's language better than any algorithm ever could.

## Page 4: Analysis That Keeps You in Control

**Step 3: Conduct Transparent Analysis**

The analysis screen shows your starting point honestly: 0 files, 0 questions, 0 keywords. Each zero represents YOUR decision to make, not an algorithm's assumption.

That checkbox for "Show segment preview"? It keeps context visible, because meaning lives in surrounding sentences. When you code, you see the full picture, not decontextualized fragments.

Click "Start Analysis" and watch what happens: CAITA shows every step, lets you pause, adjust, reconsider. You're conducting analysis, not receiving it.

**Step 4: Share Your Discoveries**

Currently showing "No results available yet," this screen embodies CAITA's philosophy: results emerge from YOUR analysis, not algorithmic generation.

After analysis, this transforms into:
- **Thematic maps** of your discovered patterns
- **Coded segments** with full context preserved
- **Complete audit trails** for methodology sections
- **Export options** for any format you need

Every decision documented. Every interpretation traceable. Every insight yours.
